# Yummly API Get Started
This is a quick place to get started with the Yummly API and see recipes that it returns based on nutritional value.

## Getting Started
In the `apitest.js` file, input your `appid` and `appkey`.

## Notes
There are other nutritional values available as well, look through the script and uncomment the values that you would like to test out.

Also, there are other parameters available. Look through the script to see what else you can search for recipes by.
